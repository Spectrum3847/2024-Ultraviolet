# 2023-24 SpectrumTraining Project

Used for training new students on WPILib and Spectrum's code structure.

## Description

This project isn't intended to run on any robot. It's classes are designed to be used in the simulator and to be used as examples for new students. We will also develop some of the code in this project to be used on our competition robot.

## Robot Requirements

This project assumes your robot is swerve drive running an MK4i setup with TalonFX controlled motors, it also assumes you are using a Pigeon 2.0 as the gyro for the robot. The robot may use a canivore or the rio canbus for any of the motors.
